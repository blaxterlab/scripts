score difference) into a third file

no description

blastm8_filter.pl
=
handy for checking "completeness" etc (eg tblastn protein seq against test genome, how many proteins are present
at 70% completeness...)

=
no description

clc_assembly_table_a_chrontig_st_en.pl
=
converts clc assembly_table -a full text alignments into a 3 column tabular format: reference
CONTIGNAME START END

for pulling out reads from a fasta or fastq file based on regexp or include lists, or exclude lists

fastx_separate.pl

fgrep.pl
=
same as fgrep, but written in perl. Search for fgrep.pl in thesis github

=
Uses a map file (old_value<tab>new_value) - replaces all instances of old_value with new_value in STDIN stream (delimited
by spaces/punctuation). To do possibly - add -d delimiter option like in fgrep.pl

gff3_select.pl
=
outputs gff3 with only those contigs that are specified in a file

join.pl
=
Test it. Check with tim. Compare to unix join

nclust.pl
=
single linkage clustering. but, consider using mcl or some other clever clusterer

pick_random.pl
= picks blocks of lines (4 for fastq, 8 for paired fastq, 2 for single line fasta, etc)

remove_overlapping_blast.pl
=
Removes blast tabular rows if they overlap given intervals

seq_st_en_merge_overlapping.pl
=
Merges sequence intervals (reorders so that st < en). Starts are 1-based not 0-based

taxid2gid.pl
=
